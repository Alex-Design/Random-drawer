# Random Drawer

Draws values randomly from an array. Suitable for occasions that require the random selection of
something from a collection, such as which fruit to take from a bowl or which film to watch, etc.

To use, simply download, navigate to the folder via the terminal, edit the .php file to add more 
names/objects to the array, then run **php.randomDrawer** to pick one at random.

This mini-project may be updated in future to be more user-friendly for medium and large-scale usage.
