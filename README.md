# Random Drawer

Draws values randomly from an array. Suitable for occasions that require the random selection of
something from a collection, such as which fruit to take from a bowl or which film to watch, etc.

To use, simply download, navigate to the folder via the terminal, then type the following:

_**php randomDrawer.php**_

If you wish to use this for your own name/option-drawing purposes, then place a CSV file into the same folder, and put the following into the terminal:

_**php randomDrawer.php nameOfCSVToRead.csv**_

If no CSV is provided, i.e if only: **php randomDrawer.php** is input into the terminal, then one of the default example CSVs will be read from instead.

Feel free to modify the code as you desire, to see how it works.

This mini-project may be updated in future to be more user-friendly for larger-scale usage.
